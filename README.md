# Examplify

Exploring the capacity of using Neural Networks and Algorithms to dynamically schedule University of Toronto student schedules.

Findings: Implemented RNN can predict class difficulty with 5% error using minimal data input.

Currently in the process of researching alternative solutions to RNN's and to establish the connection between the web-interface and the backend.
